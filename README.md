# CITS3200_6

We are requiring a software program that will transcribe our student logbooks, to be completed in Qualtrics, to readable reports for each student, showing where they are placed, which activity and how many hours they completed with each Host and then their final reports to be placed into our Sonia Placement Software.

I have an example, from our 4th year placements, similar to what I would require. The database needs to be robust and user friendly so if our Hosts change or hours of particular student skills change, we can easily adapt the database to continue to work. The data also needs to be secure.

Thank you for your consideration.

## Graphs Macro
> macro is defined in /app/views/macros/charts.jinja

### Usage

#### 1. Pass the data through to the template from routes.py or anywhere a template is rendered
> Sample data passed into example.html
```python
data = [
    {
        'title': 'Testing 1',
        'id': 'test1',
        'yMax': '0',
        'domains': ('Cardiovascular', 'Musculosceletal', 'Metabolic'),
        'hours': [
            ('Referrals, Screening or Assessmnts', (3, 8, 12)),
            ('Excercise Prescription', (9, 9, 9)),
            ('Excercise Delivery', (0, 2, 4)),
            ('Other', (3, 8, 9)),
        ]
    },
    {
        'title': 'Testing 2',
        'id': 'test2',
        'yMax': '200',
        'domains': ('Cardiovascular', 'Musculosceletal', 'Metabolic'),
        'hours': [
            ('Referrals, Screening or Assessmnts', (32, 8, 12)),
            ('Excercise Prescription', (9, 19, 49)),
            ('Excercise Delivery', (10, 2, 24)),
            ('Other', (13, 28, 9)),
        ]
    },
    ]
return render_template('example.html', data=data)
```

#### 2. From the template, import the macro
```jinja
{% import "macros/charts.jinja" as charts %}
```

#### 3. Now within the head block, call the chart_head macro
```jinja
{{ charts.chart_head(data) }}
```

#### 4. Use the chart_div macro to create a div where you wish to inject chart
> Must call once for each dict's id in the data array, this is where it will be created
```jinja
{{ charts.chart_div(id) }}
```
