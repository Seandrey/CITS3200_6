        Units as described by Jo:
        SSEH2295: 40. "definitely". 40 hours in that unit only.
        SSEH3345: 25 (2298 doesn't count). 25 in that unit only. 
        SSEH3385: 25 (2298 doesn't count)
        SSEH3393: 140 (earlier hours count towards it)
        SSEH3394: 140 (earlier hours count towards it)
        Apparently students can, but shouldn't, do units out of order (e.g. 2298 after 3345)
        DOn't worry about 4th year.
        She notes 45 and 85 are incompatible, and 93 and 94 are incompatible.
